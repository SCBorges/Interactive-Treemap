# Interactive-Treemap
TO DO:
Finish Writing Pilot Study Draft:
- [ ] Introduction (NOT SURE IF SUPER IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS SECTION ROBUST YET)
- [ ] Experimental Design (MULTIPLE OF PARTS)
- [x] ED - Purpose of Study / Goals
- [x] ED - Evaluation Metrics
- [x] ED - Subjects (NOT SURE HOW SPECIFIC I NEED TO BE WITH THIS SECTION)
- [ ] ED - Experimentation Approach
- [x] ED - Tasks Employed (ok for now, could refine)
- [ ] ED - Experiment Part 1: Effectiveness of Interactive Direct Comparison
  - (noColorIntuitive vs noColorTraditional)
- [ ] ED - Experiment Part 2: Effectiveness of Interactive Explicit Shearing
  - (noColorIntuitive vs noColorTraditional)
- [ ] ED - Experiment Part 3: Effectiveness of Depth-Based Color Encoding w/ Interactive Methods
  - (nocolorIntuitive vs depthColorIntuitive vs depthColorTraditional)
- [ ] ED - Experiment Part 4: Effectiveness of Containment-Based Color Encoding w/ Interactive Methods
  - (nocolorIntuitive vs containColorIntuitive vs containColorTraditional)

<!--Additional Functionality for Treemap:-->
<!--- [ ] Group Comparison Functionality-->
<!--- [ ] Multiple Treemap Functionality (See http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/)-->

TO DO for pilot study:
- [ ] Make a more traditional WIMP version of current treemap version.
- [ ] Add a mouse-enter/leave event for poping up the current containment node(parent) of the currently hovered leaf. (URGENT since I am not going to be able to use color hues as a third encoding for the tree containment structure)
